frosty
======

A  terminal small-Internet client.  Currently implements  both  the  Gemini  and
Gopher protocols.

frosty aims to be  a  reasonably simple client, though placing a strong emphasis
on efficiency (features mostly vi-like keybindings), pretty typography,  and the
ability surf  "offline"  via archived/local copies of pages and directories.

The project is written in C and is Makefile-based.   The only dependency  as  of
yet is  a TLS/crypto library.  The project is known to build successfully and be
fully functional with both the OpenSSL and LibreSSL libraries.

frosty is licensed under terms of the GPLv3 free software license.
