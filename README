NOTE: there are plans for a full re-write of sr71 to address specific flaws in
      the program and serious security concerns.  The repository will at some
      point be migrated to:

        https://git.skec.site/pub/sr71.git

      The software is highly experimental and in it's current state should be
      considered alpha-/prototype-quality.  Use at your own risk!

A  terminal small-Internet client.  Currently implements  both  the  Gemini  and
Gopher protocols.

sr71 aims  to  be  a  reasonably simple client, though placing a strong emphasis
on efficiency (features mostly vi-like keybindings), pretty typography,  and the
ability surf  "offline"  via archived/local copies of pages and directories.

The project is written in C and is Makefile-based.   The only dependency  as  of
yet is  a TLS/crypto library.  The project is known to build successfully and be
fully functional with both the OpenSSL and LibreSSL libraries.

sr71 is licensed under terms of the GPLv3 free software license.
